/* This style is used for tables where Uploadify is used. The associated label with the widget
 * is often placed in the vertical center of the table cell. Whenever the queue boxes are placed
 * beneath the Uploadify widget, within the same row as the label, the vertical center property
 * of the label causes it to be moved to the center of the height of the row. This is a rather
 * unsightly appearance. This style keeps the label a fixed distance from the top of the row,
 * and therefore eliminates the movement of the label.
